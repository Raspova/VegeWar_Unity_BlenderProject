First Time using mirror, i'm making an RTS, 
Fisrt step whould be to generate the same map for all clients,
So, in my custom NetworkManager ()
im generating a list of random int on the server start,
"randValue = intanciateWorld.generateRandVal();"
I would like to send this list to all client when they connect to the server,
OnServerConnect run on the server when a client connect,
so send the list i tried using a seperate NetworkBehaviour class whit a [ClientRpc] ,
but i asume there a way to sync the list from the NetworkManager, please help thanx.
I just need too sync a list of int from the server to all client when they connect.
